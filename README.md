Image Classification with Transfer Learning

Image Classification with Transfer Learning
Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning to classify images of flowers into five categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. Using TensorFlow and the pre-trained VGG16 model, the project highlights how pre-trained models can be adapted for new tasks with minimal computational resources.

The dataset has been reduced to 10 images per class, enabling quick training and evaluation, making it suitable for educational and demonstration purposes.

Key Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning.
Small Dataset: Focuses on a limited dataset for fast execution.
Evaluation:
Accuracy and loss plots for training and validation.
Confusion matrix for performance visualization.
Modular Code: Clearly organized into sections for data preparation, model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
Technologies Used
TensorFlow: For building and training the model.
Keras Applications: To load the pre-trained VGG16 model.
Matplotlib: For plotting training and evaluation metrics.
Scikit-learn: For generating and visualizing the confusion matrix.
